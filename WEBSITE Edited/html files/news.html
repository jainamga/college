        <p>
            NEW DELHI: Indian handset maker Micromax will invest Rs 200 crore into washing machines, refrigerators and air coolers, over the next 12 to 18 months, as it diversifies into new segments and moves towards becoming a consumer electronics brand.<br/>
            The company expects consumer electronics to contribute 30%, up from 20% now, to the overall estimated revenue of Rs 5,400 crore by 2020, which will also be a 20% growth over its revenue estimate for the year ending March 2019.<br/>

        <h2>Aqueous storage device needs only 20 seconds to go!</h2>
        <p>
            A KAIST research team developed a new hybrid energy storage device that can be charged in less than half a minute. It employs aqueous electrolytes instead of flammable organic solvents, so it is both environmentally friendly and safe. It also facilitates a boosting charge with high energy density, which makes it suitable for portable electronic devices.<br/>

        <p>
            The harnessing of solar energy has made Diu the countryâ€™s first energy surplus Union territory and a model for an effective way for people to harness this renewable energy source.<br/>
                In just three years, Diu has made rapid progress in solar power generation. The Union territory has an area of just 42 square kilometres. Despite scarcity of land, solar power plants have been installed over more than 50 acres.<br/>
                Diu generates a total of 13 megawatts of electricity from solar power generating facilities daily. Around 3 MW is generated by rooftop solar plants and 10 MW by its other solar power plants.<br/>
